## Using the search algorithm visualizer
The search visualizer requires both a start and target point to be set. To set the start point, right click on a cell once (it will turn green). To set the target point, right click on a cell twice (it will turn black). Left clicking on a cell makes the cell an obstruction. To reset a cell, continue clicking right or left until the cell turns white.
